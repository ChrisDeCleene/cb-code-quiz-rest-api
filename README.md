# CB-Code Quiz App REST API
> In an effort to grow as developers and learn in a production setting, we are building a fully-functional REST API for coding Quizzes using a TDD approach (test-driven development) and MVC (model-view-controller) pattern.
> Live demo [_here_](https://www.example.com). <!-- If you have the project hosted somewhere, include the link here. -->
